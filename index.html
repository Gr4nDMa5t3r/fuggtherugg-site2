      <h3>Meet Fugg</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Fugg! Unlike your ordinary Rug, <br/>
        I’ve been woven with an unpullable Thread. <br/>
        So go ahead, Give me a Tug, See if I’ll move, See if I’ll budge. <br/>
        Because I won’t, This I promise you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I am one, Rugs, I do not like! They make me boil with Rage! <br/>
        One might say I too am a Rug, I agree to disagree. <br/>
        I love feet, toes and heels, Take off your Socks, <br/>
        Step on me and feel the Love, From me, Fugg, The unpullable Rugg!
      </p>
